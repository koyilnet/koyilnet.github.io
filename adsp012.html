                    In Shakti Kanchi, there are two Kamakshi temples. One is old 
                    and another one is new. The old temple, Adi peetha 
                    Parameswari temple present near Kanchi kamakoti peeth. Some 
                    people consider that this is the original temple of Kamakshi 
                    mata. The new temple, which is famous temple of Kanchi 
                    kamakshi mata is also present near old temple. This is a big 
                    temple complex. Kamakshi mata present here in the form of 
                    Lalita devi. Previously Kamakashi mata present in hard form, 
                    but Jagadguru Adishankaracharya established Srichakra and 
                    cooled her, and started Goddess Lalita worship. A Kamakoti 
                    bila (cave) present in the sanctum sanctorum. The entrance 
                    present behind the goddess idol. A pushkarini (holy lake) 
                    present back to sanctum sanctorum. One day Lord Shiva enterd 
                    unexpectedly into Maa Parvati's place. At that time some 
                    yoginis were present without dress. </font></b></i></td>

                    close the three eyes of Lord Shiva immediately without any 
                    thought. But as Lord Shiva's eyes resemble Sun, Moon, and 
                    fire, the world became dark completely because of Maa 
                    Parvathis action. Goddess Parvathi also became dark. She 
                    surprised and asked Lord Shiva how this happened? and how to 
                    remove her dark color complexion? Lord shiva explained the 
                    reason and advised her to do penance to get rid off the sin 
                    that was generated by her action.<br>
                    Maa parvathi accepted and came to earth as Katyayini 
                    (Daughter of Katyayana maharshi) and went to Varanasi and 
                    became as Annapurna and did annadana and changed her dark 
                    coplexion into golden comnplexion. After that she came to 
                    Kanchi and did penance for Lord shiva. She did penance with 
                    pancha bana mantra beneath a mango tree. Lord Shiva suffered 
                    with this penance and send Ganga mata to test her devotion. 
                    Ganga mata came aggressively to destroy Maa Parvthi puja. 
                    But Maa parvathi stopped and caught Ganga in a holy Kapala, 
                    along with Ganga Lord shiva also caught in that holy Kapala. 
                    Lord Shiva became angry and increased water flow 
                    tremendously, Maa Parvathi afraid and praised Maha vishnu 
                    for advise. He advised to completely surrender to Lord Shiva 
                    and this is the only solution in this critical situation. 
                    Maa parvathi praised lord Shiva and hugged Shiva linga and 
                    completely surrendered to Lord Shiva. Today also we can see 
                    some marks of Parvathi mata jewels on Ekamreshwara Shiva 
                    linga. A manog tree also present in Ekamreshwar temple. Lord 
                    Shiva accepted her devotion and married her again on request 
                    of Pramatha ganas. Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma and Katyayana 
                    maharshi conducted the Shiva paravtahi kalyanam. At that 
                    time Maa Parvathi fulfilled all her devotees desires with 
                    her looks. hence the name Kamakshi mata.</font></b></i></td>
