                    Shankaracharya’s Stotram starts with Shankari Devi Shakthi 
                    Peeth. Here Devi Sati’s groin had fallen. Sati Devi is 
                    worshipped as Shankari Devi and Lord Shiva as Trikoneshwara. 
                    The temple is located in Trimkomali, or Trincomalee on the 
                    eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The place Trinconmalee means a 
                    triangular shaped hill (Tri- cona- malee or malai). The 
                    temple is well connected by roads. There is also a Kali 
                    temple which people visit enroute to Shankari Devi 
                    temple.The Temple of Sri Shankari Devi according to the 
                    priest's in Trincomalee, say that the Portuguese who invaded 
                    the island in the 17th century completely cannon balled from 
                    their ship and demolished the cliff top Devi temple. In its 
                    site stands a lone pillar, as a mute spectator. The present 
                    Shiva temple which is quite well known locally than the 
                    Shankari Temple was a recent construction. </font></b></i></td>

                    called as TRIKONESHVARA (Probably because it is in 
                    Trincomalee which is truly TRI CONA MALAI- meaning triangle 
                    shaped hill). There is a small Devi Shrine built adjacent 
                    the Shiva temple. The famed Bilva tree which is perched 
                    right on the edge of the hill some hundred meters above the 
                    Indian ocean. It is a exhilarating and spectacular sight to 
                    behold. All round, silence reflects which is needed most in 
                    this war torn nation rightfully called as a paradise. There 
                    is also a more famous Kali temple in the heart of the town 
                    to which devotees can make a visit en-route from the 
                    Shankari Temple. According to one Puranic reference, Parvati 
                    Devi requested Lord Shiva to build a palace for her. But 
                    Shiva, used to living in Mount Kailash did not heed to her 
                    request. After several requests from Parvati, Lord Shiva 
                    finally relented and asked Vishwakarma to build a palace. 
                    Vishwakarma built a beautiful palace in Lanka Dweep for 
                    Parvati Devi. Lord Shiva and Parvati came to Lanka to 
                    perform the Griha Pravesh of their palace. Ravana was doing 
                    a rigorous penance to get the blessings of Lord Shiva. Lord 
                    Shiva and Parvati Devi were pleased with the penance of 
                    Ravana and Lord Shiva blessed Ravana with boons. Ravana, a 
                    Brahmin by birth and master of all the four Vedas was a 
                    great devotee of Lord Shiva. Pleased by his penance, Parvati 
                    Devi asked Ravana to perform the rituals associated with the 
                    Griha Pravesh of their palace. Parvati Devi was impressed 
                    with Ravana who did the Griha Pravesh rituals and wanted to 
                    bless him with a boon. She asked Ravana to ask for a boon, 
                    and he asked for the Lanka palace. Parvati Devi, though 
                    saddened initially by the wish of Ravana granted the boon 
                    and gave away the palace as Dakshina. However, Ravana 
                    requested Parvati Devi to stay at the palace. Parvati Devi 
                    agreed to stay at the palace as Shankari Devi with the 
                    condition that she would stay at the palace, as long as 
                    Ravana pays heed to her words. Trouble began when Ravana, 
                    overcome by carnal desire, kidnapped Seetha and brought her 
                    to Lanka. Shankari devi was angered by this base action of 
                    Ravana. She asked him to leave Seetha and return her to Rama. 
                    But lust clung to Ravana like a leech and he did not obey 
                    Devi’s advice. Highly disappointed, Shankari left the island 
                    country and with her left all the peace and prosperity of 
                    the kingdom.When Vibheeshana was crowned by Rama as the 
                    emperor of Lanka, he prayed that Shankari devi once again 
                    take residence in the island nation. Shankari Devi accepted 
                    his prayers and re-entered her temple, bringing glory to 
                    Lanka once again.</font></b></i></td>
